This is a Python GUI application built using [wxFormBuilder](https://github.com/wxFormBuilder/wxFormBuilder) for interacting with the Parrot Bebop2 drone using [PyParrot](https://github.com/amymcgovern/pyparrot). The purpose is be able to more easily create PyParrot commands to interact with the Parrot Bebop2 drone during the 2020 summer drone internship.  
  
To be able to run this program, PyParrot and wxPython will need to be installed. Check out [Pyparrot Installation](https://pyparrot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for more instructions.
